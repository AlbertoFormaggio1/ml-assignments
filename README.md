# Machine Learning

The Machine Learning course focused on:
1) Supervised learning:
    - Goodness of a model
    - Complexity
    - No Free Lunch theorem
    - Linear Regression and Regularization (L1, L2 Regularization)
    - Non linear models: Logistic Regression and NNs
    - SVMs
    - Bayes Classifier
    - Evaluation of classifiers
2) Unsupervised learning:
    - k-means clustering
    - Hierarchical clustering
    - Scoring techniques

The assignments will try to look in detail some of these aspects.

### Homework 1: Linear Regression

### Homework 2: SVM and Logistic Regression

### Homework 3: Neural Networks and K-means clustering
